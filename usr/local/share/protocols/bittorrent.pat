# It will, however, not work on bittorrent streams that are encrypted, since
# it's impossible to match (well) encrypted data.

bittorrent

# Does not attempt to match the HTTP download of the tracker
# 0x13 is the length of "bittorrent protocol"
# Second two bits match UDP wierdness
# Next bit matches something Azureus does
# Ditto on the next bit.  Could also match on "user-agent: azureus", but that's in the next
# packet and perhaps this will match multiple clients.
# bitcomet-specific strings contributed by liangjun.

# This is not a valid GNU basic regular expression (but that's ok).
