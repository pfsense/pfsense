		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

   CREATIVE  COMMONS  CORPORATION  IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
   LEGAL  SERVICES.  DISTRIBUTION  OF  THIS  LICENSE  DOES  NOT CREATE AN
   ATTORNEY-CLIENT   RELATIONSHIP.   CREATIVE   COMMONS   PROVIDES   THIS
   INFORMATION  ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
   REGARDING  THE  INFORMATION  PROVIDED,  AND  DISCLAIMS  LIABILITY  FOR
   DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

   License

   THE  WORK  (AS  DEFINED  BELOW)  IS  PROVIDED  UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
   CREATIVE  COMMONS  PUBLIC  LICENSE  ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
   PROTECTED  BY  COPYRIGHT  AND/OR  OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
   WORK  OTHER  THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
   PROHIBITED.

   BY  EXERCISING  ANY  RIGHTS  TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
   AGREE  TO  BE  BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
   YOU  THE  RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
   SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions
    a. "Collective  Work"  means  a  work,  such  as  a periodical issue,
       anthology  or  encyclopedia,  in which the Work in its entirety in
       unmodified  form,  along  with  a  number  of other contributions,
       constituting  separate  and  independent  works in themselves, are
       assembled  into  a  collective  whole.  A  work that constitutes a
       Collective  Work  will  not  be  considered  a Derivative Work (as
       defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative  Work"  means  a  work based upon the Work or upon the
       Work  and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
       arrangement,   dramatization,   fictionalization,  motion  picture
       version,    sound   recording,   art   reproduction,   abridgment,
       condensation,  or  any other form in which the Work may be recast,
       transformed,  or  adapted,  except  that a work that constitutes a
       Collective  Work  will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
       purpose  of  this  License.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work   is   a   musical   composition   or  sound  recording,  the
       synchronization  of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
       ("synching")  will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
       of this License.
    c. "Licensor"  means  the  individual  or entity that offers the Work
       under the terms of this License.
    d. "Original  Author"  means the individual or entity who created the
       Work.
    e. "Work"  means  the  copyrightable work of authorship offered under
       the terms of this License.
    f. "You"  means  an individual or entity exercising rights under this
       License  who has not previously violated the terms of this License
       with  respect  to the Work, or who has received express permission
       from  the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
       previous violation.
    g. "License   Elements"   means   the  following  high-level  license
       attributes  as  selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
       this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.

   2.  Fair  Use  Rights.  Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit,  or  restrict  any  rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
   copyright law or other applicable laws.

   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor  hereby  grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual  (for  the  duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    a. to  reproduce  the  Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly,  and  perform  publicly  by  means  of  a  digital audio
       transmission  the  Work  including  as  incorporated in Collective
       Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly,  and  perform  publicly  by  means  of  a  digital audio
       transmission Derivative Works.
    e. For   the  avoidance  of  doubt,  where  the  work  is  a  musical
       composition:
         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            performance   rights   society   (e.g.  ASCAP,  BMI,  SESAC),
            royalties  for  the  public  performance  or  public  digital
            performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
        ii. Mechanical  Rights  and  Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            music  rights  society  or  designated  agent (e.g. Harry Fox
            Agency),  royalties  for  any phonorecord You create from the
            Work   ("cover  version")  and  distribute,  subject  to  the
            compulsory  license  created  by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    f. Webcasting  Rights  and  Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
       doubt,  where  the  Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
       exclusive   right  to  collect,  whether  individually  or  via  a
       performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
       public  digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
       the  compulsory  license  created  by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
       Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
   known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
   such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
   in  other  media  and  formats.  All  rights  not expressly granted by
   Licensor are hereby reserved.

   4.  Restrictions.The  license  granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You   may  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally  perform the Work only under the terms of this
       License,  and  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
       Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
       Work  You  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
       on  the  Work  that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
       the  recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
       not  sublicense  the  Work.  You must keep intact all notices that
       refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
       not  distribute,  publicly  display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally  perform  the  Work with any technological measures that
       control  access  or  use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
       the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
       as  incorporated  in  a Collective Work, but this does not require
       the  Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
       to  the  terms  of  this License. If You create a Collective Work,
       upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove  from  the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
       4(c),  as  requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
       from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
       the  Derivative  Work  any  credit  as required by clause 4(c), as
       requested.
    b. You   may  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms
       of  this  License,  a  later version of this License with the same
       License  Elements  as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons
       license  that  contains  the same License Elements as this License
       (e.g.  Attribution-ShareAlike  2.5 Japan). You must include a copy
       of,  or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
       license  specified  in  the  previous  sentence with every copy or
       phonorecord  of  each  Derivative  Work  You  distribute, publicly
       display,  publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
       not  offer  or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
       or  restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise
       of  the  rights  granted  hereunder,  and You must keep intact all
       notices  that  refer  to  this  License  and  to the disclaimer of
       warranties.  You  may  not  distribute, publicly display, publicly
       perform,  or  publicly  digitally perform the Derivative Work with
       any  technological measures that control access or use of the Work
       in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
       The  above  applies  to  the  Derivative Work as incorporated in a
       Collective  Work,  but  this  does not require the Collective Work
       apart  from  the  Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the
       terms of this License.
    c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally  perform  the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective
       Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
       provide,  reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
       the  name  of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
       supplied,  and/or  (ii)  if  the  Original  Author and/or Licensor
       designate  another  party  or  parties  (e.g. a sponsor institute,
       publishing   entity,   journal)   for  attribution  in  Licensor's
       copyright  notice,  terms of service or by other reasonable means,
       the  name  of  such  party  or  parties;  the title of the Work if
       supplied;  to  the  extent  reasonably  practicable,  the  Uniform
       Resource  Identifier,  if  any,  that  Licensor  specifies  to  be
       associated  with  the  Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
       copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the
       case  of  a  Derivative  Work, a credit identifying the use of the
       Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work
       by  Original  Author,"  or  "Screenplay  based on original Work by
       Original   Author").   Such  credit  may  be  implemented  in  any
       reasonable  manner;  provided,  however,  that  in  the  case of a
       Derivative  Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
       appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in
       a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
       credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS  OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
   THE  WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
   CONCERNING  THE  MATERIALS,  EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
   INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
   FITNESS  FOR  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
   LATENT  OR  OTHER  DEFECTS,  ACCURACY,  OR  THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS,  WHETHER  OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
   THE  EXCLUSION  OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
   TO YOU.

   6.   Limitation  on  Liability.  EXCEPT  TO  THE  EXTENT  REQUIRED  BY
   APPLICABLE  LAW,  IN  NO  EVENT  WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL  THEORY  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
   EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
   EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination
    a. This  License  and  the  rights  granted  hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals  or  entities  who  have  received Derivative Works or
       Collective  Works  from  You under this License, however, will not
       have  their  licenses  terminated  provided  such  individuals  or
       entities  remain  in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
       1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject  to  the  above  terms and conditions, the license granted
       here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
       the  Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
       to  release  the  Work  under  different  license terms or to stop
       distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
       election  will  not  serve  to withdraw this License (or any other
       license  that  has  been,  or is required to be, granted under the
       terms  of  this  License),  and this License will continue in full
       force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
       a  Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
       to  the  Work  on  the  same  terms  and conditions as the license
       granted to You under this License.
    b. Each   time   You  distribute  or  publicly  digitally  perform  a
       Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
       original  Work  on  the  same  terms and conditions as the license
       granted to You under this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
       of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
       action  by  the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
       reformed  to  the  minimum extent necessary to make such provision
       valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
       breach  consented  to  unless  such  waiver or consent shall be in
       writing  and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
       consent.
    e. This  License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
       with   respect   to   the   Work   licensed  here.  There  are  no
       understandings,  agreements or representations with respect to the
       Work  not  specified  here.  Licensor  shall  not  be bound by any
       additional  provisions  that  may appear in any communication from
       You.  This  License may not be modified without the mutual written
       agreement of the Licensor and You.

   license.  Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative

   shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
