# This pattern has been tested somewhat.

# this is a difficult protocol to match because of the relative lack of 
# distinguishing information.  Read on.
pop3

# this the most conservative pattern.  It should definitely work.
#^(\+ok|-err)

# this pattern assumes that the server says _something_ after +ok or -err
# I think this is probably the way to go.
^(\+ok |-err )

# more that 90% of servers seem to say "pop" after "+ok", but not all.
#^(\+ok .*pop)

# Here's another tack. I think this is my second favorite.
#^(\+ok [\x09-\x0d -~]*(ready|hello|pop|starting)|-err [\x09-\x0d -~]*(invalid|unknown|unimplemented|unrecognized|command))

# this matches the server saying "you have N messages that are M bytes",
# which the client probably asks for early in the session (not tested)
#\+ok [0-9]+ [0-9]+

# some sample servers:
# RFC example:        +OK POP3 server ready <1896.697170952@dbc.mtview.ca.us>
