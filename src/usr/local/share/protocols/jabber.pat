# This pattern has been tested with Gaim and Gabber.  It is only tested 
# with non-SSL mode Jabber with no proxies.

# Thanks to Jan Hudec for some improvements.

# Jabber seems to take a long time to set up a connection.  I'm
# connecting with Gabber 0.8.8 to 12jabber.org and the first 8 packets
# is this:
# <stream:stream to='12jabber.com' xmlns='jabber:client'
# xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'><?xml
# version='1.0'?><stream:stream
# xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams' id='3f73e951'
# xmlns='jabber:client' from='12jabber.com'>
#
# No mention of my username or password yet, you'll note.
